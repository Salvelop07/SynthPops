What's new

Starting with SynthPops version 1.5.2, this file will document all changes to the codebase. By nature, SynthPops is a library to generate stochastic networked populations, so over time there will be model and code updates that change regression results. When these kinds of changes are made, we'll flag that here with the term "Regression Information". In addition, here are some other terms useful for understanding updates documented here.
