# SynthPops

SynthPops is a module designed to generate synthetic populations that are used for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic analyses. SynthPops can create generic populations with different network characteristics, as well as synthetic populations that interact in different layers of a multilayer contact network.


The code was developed to explore the impact of contact tracing and testing in human contact networks in combination with our [Covasim repository](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/covasim).

More extensive installation and usage instructions are in the [SynthPops documentation](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/synthpops/).

## Installation

Python >=3.6 is required. Python 2 is not supported. Virtual environments are recommended but not required.

`python setup.py develop`

NOTE: This module needs to load in data in order to function. To set the data location, do

```python
import synthpops as sp
sp.set_datadir('my-data-folder')
```
The data folder will need to have files in this kind of structure:

```bash
demographics/
contact_matrices_152_countries/
```
You can find this data under the data folder.

## Structure

All core modeling is in the `synthpops` folder; standard usage is `import synthpops as sp`.

### data

The `data` folder contains demographic data needed and some pre-generated contact networks for populations of different sizes. Please update synthpops.datadir to point at this directory.

### licenses

The `licenses` folder contains:
* `NOTICE`: Third-party software notices and information
* `notice.py`: Scraper to auto-generate the NOTICE file.

### synthpops

The `synthpops` folder contains:

* `__init__.py`
* `api.py`
* `config.py`: Methods to set where `datadir` points; this should be the path to the data folder.
* `contact_networks.py`: Functions to create a synthetic population with demographic data and places people into households, schools, and workplaces.
* `contacts.py`: Functions to create other types of contact networks and load multilayer networks.
* `plot_tools.py`: Functions to plot an age-mixing matrix for a layer in the contact network.
* `synthpops.py`: Functions to call in demographic data and sampling functions.
* `version.py`: Version and date.

### tests

The `tests` folder contains tests of different functions available in SynthPops.
